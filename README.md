# Open Summer of Code 2022 - Technical Support

> 🤖 Welcome, you've reached the (almost automated) oSoc'22 technical support!

## There is no stupid question

Ask your fellow students and coaches, **there is no stupid question**!  
You will find on *Discord* dedicated channels where the other participants (students and coaches) will help you: `#accessibility`, `#design`, `#development`, `#mapping`, `#pitching`, ...

## Technical support

> 🤖 For specific tasks, you will need me...  
> My bionic brain is only connected to this repository, this is the only way to contact me and I'll use it to get back to you.

### Create a new ticket

- [Create a new issue](https://github.com/osoc21/technical-support/issues/new/choose) in this repository
- Be as clear as possible about what you need my help for or what you need me to setup for your project
- Once the issue is created, the triage will automatically start
- I'll assign a [priority](https://github.com/osoc21/technical-support/labels?q=priority) on your request
- I'll take care of your request
- If I need any additional information, I'll contact you **through the issue**

### Triage board

At any time, you'll be able to see the status of your request in the [triage board](https://github.com/osoc21/technical-support/projects/1).

1. `🙋‍♂️ To do`: Your request has entered the system
2. `⏳ In progress`: Your request is being processed
3. `⚠ On hold`: There is something blocking your request, I probably need more information from you
4. `✔ Done`: Your request has been processed and is complete

Your request will have one of the following priorities:

1. [`priority-1`](https://github.com/osoc22/technical-support/labels/priority%201): I will take care of it immediately
2. [`priority-2`](https://github.com/osoc22/technical-support/labels/priority%202): I will take care of it as soon as possible 
3. [`priority-3`](https://github.com/osoc22/technical-support/labels/priority%203): I will take care of it when I have a moment

If I need more information from you, I'll assign the label [`question`](https://github.com/osoc21/technical-support/labels/question)!  
If I need help from someone else to complete your request, I'll assign the label [`help wanted`](https://github.com/osoc21/technical-support/labels/help%20wanted)!
